      Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it
      right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house,
      fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
      better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm
      sayin'? Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic
      tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
      Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
      mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well,
      that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy
      store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. Now that
      there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is
      advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that
      shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the
      most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that
      shit. Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
      but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
      don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it
      don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
      morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. My money's in
      that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't
      there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in
      the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps,
      find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me
      when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and
      that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker
      to get shot. You understand?
